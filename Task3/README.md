In this task, I cleaned and analyzed the Kaggle Data Science Survey dataset. I skipped metadata rows, selected only relevant columns (country, education, job, salary, programming language), handled missing values, standardized text formatting, and encoded categorical data into numbers. Finally, I generated insights like the most common countries and education levels among respondents and exported the cleaned dataset for further analysis, followed by visualisations in the end.
