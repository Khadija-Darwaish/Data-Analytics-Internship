Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

OBJECTIVE

The aim of this task is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using the RFM model:
Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase.
Frequency (F): How often they made purchases.
Monetary (M): How much money they spent.
This analysis helps identify loyal customers, inactive customers, and high-value buyers for targeted marketing.
